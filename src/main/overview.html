<h1>Gutek Application Overview</h1>
<p>
    Gutek is a Java-based application designed to support intelligent learning through
    customizable revision algorithms. The application integrates Spring Boot for backend
    management and JavaFX for the graphical user interface, allowing users to manage
    language learning, spaced repetition, and memory retention processes.
</p>

<h2>Main Components</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>gutek</strong>: The main package, containing the entry point for the application in the {@code Main} class.</li>
    <li><strong>gutek.gui</strong>: Contains all graphical user interface components, organized in sub-packages for charts, controllers, and custom controls.</li>
    <li><strong>gutek.services</strong>: Provides business logic and service classes, including translation and revision algorithm management.</li>
    <li><strong>gutek.entities</strong>: Contains JPA entities representing key data models, such as cards, decks, and users.</li>
    <li><strong>gutek.repositories</strong>: Spring Data JPA repositories for managing persistence of entities.</li>
    <li><strong>gutek.utils</strong>: Utility classes that provide common functionality, including validation, alert management, and FXML loading.</li>
    <li><strong>gutek.config</strong>: Configuration classes for setting up Spring beans and application properties.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Intelligent revision algorithms with support for bidirectional learning</li>
    <li>Customizable and extensible framework for adding new algorithms and views</li>
    <li>Automated database management with Spring Data JPA</li>
    <li>Statistics and analytics to track learning progress</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
    To run the application, start by initializing the Spring Boot context in the {@code Main} class.
    This will set up the JavaFX interface and display the main stage for interacting with learning tools and settings.
